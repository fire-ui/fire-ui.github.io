# Card
To use Fire UI card feature, copy and paste this stylesheet tag into your `head` element to load Fire UI card CSS.

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@fire-ui/fire-ui@0.2.6/src/feature/Card/card.min.css">
```

## Example:
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-3">
        <div class="card theme-reverse">
            <h1 class="card-title">Fire UI</h1>
            <img src = "https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/318472038/56056f00-3883-11eb-887b-55ee534a36f5" alt="Fire UI logo" />
            <div class="card-info">
                Quickly design your website with Fire UI, an open-source project aimed to contain everything that is frequently used on the frontend. Fire UI supports a single folder for certain features to reduce CSS file size.
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

```
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-3">
        <div class="card theme-reverse">
            <h1 class="card-title">Fire UI</h1>
            <img src = "https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/318472038/56056f00-3883-11eb-887b-55ee534a36f5" alt="Fire UI logo" />
            <div class="card-info">

            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

## Things to note
Please combine card with the Grid System, or give it a width. Otherwise, it will take all the width of your web page.
